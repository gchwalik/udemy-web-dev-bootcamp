#Introduction to Express

Framework vs Library

The most important difference, and in fact the defining difference between a
library and a framework is "Inversion of Control".

What does this mean? Well, it means that when you call a library, you are in 
control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls
you. Basically, all the controll flow is already in the framework, and there's 
a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code.

A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that you can call.
A library is something that you're in control of.

Frameworks provide the basic groundwork needed to get something off the ground, 
without having to redefine it every single time.



What is Express?
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that 
provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.



Why are we using Express?
* express is by far the most-used framework
* has a big community, with lots of documentation and tutorials
* express is a very lightweight framework
  * heavyweight framework - provides most of the structure, and optionally a 
                            lot of things you might not need
  * lightweight framework - provides the needed structure, doesn't hide anything
                            you are more in control, and learn so much more
  * express in unopinionated, which means it's super flexible [in file structure]

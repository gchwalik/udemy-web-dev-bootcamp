4 Main Objectives

Objective 1: Evaluate JS using the developer console
Objective 2: List the 5 JS primitives
Objective 3: Define variables with the var keyword
Objective 4: Write code using: console.log, alert, prompt

--------

Objective 1:
The developer console is found in the same way as the Inspecter
Can right-click and hit "Inspect", and then switch to the tab that says "Console
Also Command+Option+j on mac or Ctrl+Shift+J on Windows

--------

Objective 2:
- Introduce the 5 primitive data types
- Work with numbers and numeric operators
- Work with strings and common string methods

--

Javascript has dynamic typing, which means you can have
var temp = "hello"
temp = 73
and it will actually switch from a string to a number

Javascript var names tend to be camelcase


//Numbers
JS doesn't care if the number is whole, negative, or fractional, it defines them all as just numbers
4
9.3
-10

//Strings
"Hello World"
"43"

//Booleans
true
false

//null and undefined
These are just values, there is only one null and one undefined
null
undefined

--

//Numbers
4
9.3
-1

//We can do some math
Follows PEMDAS, but not sure if exponential exists
4 + 10    //14
4+10      //14
1 - 54    //-53
1 / 5     //0.2
2 * 10    //10

//Modulo - remainder operator
10 % 3    //1
24 % 2    //0
15 % 11   //4

--

//Strings

//Single or Double quotes OK
- But regardless of what you use, it returns it with double quotes
"hello world"
'hello world'

//Concatenation
"charlie" + "brown"   //charliebrown

//Escape Characters start with "\"
"Singing \"Do wah diddy, dum diddy do\" "
"This is a backslash: \\"

//Strings have a length property
"hello world".length    //11

//Access individual characters using [] and an index
"hello"[0]      //"h"
"hello"[4]      //"o"

--------

Objective 3: 

//Variables are simply containers that store values 
//They follow this pattern:
var yourVariableName = yourValue;

//They can store all of the values we've seen
var name = "Rusty";
var secretNumber = 73;
var isAdorable = true;

//Recall the stored value by calling the variable name
var name = "Rusty";
"hello there " + name     //"hello there Rusty"

var num = 37
num + 3 + 10      //50

//We can also update exisitng variables
var name = "Robert";
name = "Bob";

--

//The two other primitives are null and undefined

//Variables that are declared bu not
//Initialized are undefined
//The following variables are undefined:
var name;
var age;

//null is "explicitly nothing"
var currentPlayer = "charlie";
currentPlayer = null;     //game over

--

//Clear the console@
clear()

--------

//alert
//Creates a popup with the evaluation of whatever's inside
alert("Hello there!!");
alert(12345);
alert(198 * 345);

//prompt
//makes a popup with a prompt/text input
prompt("what is your name?");
var userName = prompt("what is your name?");

//console.log
//Prints something to the javascript console
console.log(12/3)     //4

Intro to Backend
- Review Internet Basics
- Static vs Dynamic Sites
- Stacks/Backend Technologies

When we go to a URL, there is a couple of things that happens

Finding the right address
www.udemy.com -> 23.235.47.175
- Your query is submitted to your ISP
- Within your ISP, the DNS takes the Domain name and turns it into an IP address

Going to that Address
www.udemy.com -> 23.235.47.175
- A request is sent to the desired IP address via HTTP
- Your request finds the fastest path possible to the server with the specified IP
- This is not a direct journey. It requires hopping from server to server until we arrive

Udemy Server Responds
www.udemy.com -> 23.235.47.175
- The requested server figures out exactly what we're asking for
- The server builds us the right content, often pulling information from database
- The server responds with any combination of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- And then...

It gets returned to the browser which renders it


Static vs Dynamic
Dynamic webpages are sites that are complied on the server side, where the server is pulling together or constructing a webpage before it's sent back as a response

Stack
All of the technologies that a particular application uses
